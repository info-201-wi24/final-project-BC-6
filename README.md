# Introduction

Welcome to our exploration into the relationship between poverty and drug overdose deaths in the United States. This project delves into essential questions surrounding the intersection of socio-economic status and public health outcomes, utilizing datasets that weave together vital statistics. Join us in deciphering the narrative that shapes the health outcomes of communities across the United States. Letâ€™s uncover the stories hidden within the numbers.

### Key Questions:
- Does a significant correlation exist between poverty rates and the prevalence of drug overdose deaths across diverse states in the U.S.?
- How do drug overdose deaths manifest across different racial groups, and to what extent does poverty contribute to these variations?
- What is the number of drug overdose deaths for each state?
- What is the percentage of people in poverty by race and state?
- How do the number of drug overdose deaths and total number of people in poverty compare by region?

### Dataset at a Glance:
The datasets that we used offer a detailed exploration of mortality and poverty dynamics in the United States during 2016. Our compilation uses these three datasets:

1. Drug Overdose Deaths

2. People in Poverty Based on Race for each State

3. Population by Race for each State

### Ethical Considerations:
- Privacy and Identification: Address potential privacy concerns and the risk of individual or community identification, particularly with race and region data.
- Data Accuracy: Consider the accuracy and reliability of reported death and overdose numbers, ensuring consistency in data collection methods across states.
- Ethical Use of Racial Data: Handle racial data with care to avoid reinforcing stereotypes or biases, and address the potential risks of stigmatization or discrimination.
- Implications of Poverty Percentage: Ethically interpret and present poverty percentages, considering potential consequences and avoiding misuse of the information.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

Our analysis of the relationship between poverty and drug overdose deaths in the United States reveals significant insights into the interplay of socio-economic factors and public health outcomes. Ethical considerations guided our responsible data handling.
   
### Major Takeaways
- We found a clear link between poverty rates and drug-related fatalities, emphasizing the critical role of socio-economic factors.
- Analyzing variations across racial groups highlights the impact of poverty on disparities, necessitating targeted interventions.
- State-specific insights from the datasets enable a nuanced understanding of the issue's magnitude and regional patterns.
   
Our findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive, region-specific interventions addressing both socio-economic and racial dimensions to combat the opioid epidemic and improve nationwide public health outcomes.
