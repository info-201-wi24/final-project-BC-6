# Conclusion

Our analysis of the relationship between poverty and drug overdose deaths in 
the United States reveals significant insights into the interplay of socio-economic 
factors and public health outcomes. Ethical considerations guided our responsible data handling.
   
### Major Takeaways

- We have discovered that Florida has the most drug overdose deaths, followed by 
  California, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. It makes sense for Florida and California 
  have the most drug overdose deaths since they also have the highest number of
  people, however, Pennsylvania and Ohio do not have a greater population than Texas,
  yet have a higher number of drug overdose deaths, which means that drug use in 
  these two states are significantly higher.
- People of color are more affected by poverty than white people because the highest
  percentage of white people in poverty was 17.65%, while the highest percentage
  of people in poverty for Black, Hispanic, and multiple races was 49%, 32.64%, and 
  33.76% respectively. Also, in general, people of color had higher percentages in
  poverty in all states than white people.
- In general, we can see that states in the southern region have a higher percentage of people
  in poverty as well as number of drug overdose deaths. Since it is shown that people
  of color have higher poverty rates and that states in the southern region have more drug
  overdose deaths, we can infer that people of color in poverty are more negatively affected
  by drugs than white people.

We found a clear link between the percentage of people in poverty and drug-related fatalities, 
emphasizing the critical role of socio-economic factors. Analyzing variations 
across racial groups highlights the impact of poverty on disparities, necessitating 
targeted interventions. State-specific insights from the datasets enable a nuanced 
understanding of the issue's magnitude and regional patterns. Ethical considerations 
guided our responsible data handling. Our findings underscore the urgent need for 
comprehensive, region-specific interventions addressing both socio-economic and 
racial dimensions to combat the opioid epidemic and improve nationwide public health outcomes.
