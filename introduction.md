Welcome to our exploration into the relationship between poverty and drug 
   overdose deaths in the United States. This project delves into essential 
   questions surrounding the intersection of socio-economic status and public 
   health outcomes, utilizing datasets that weave together vital statistics. 
   Join us in deciphering the narrative that shapes the health outcomes of 
   communities across the United States. Letâ€™s uncover the stories hidden within 
   the numbers.
   
### Key Questions:
- Does a significant correlation exist between poverty rates 
             and the prevalence of drug overdose deaths across diverse 
             states in the U.S.?
-  How do drug overdose deaths manifest across different racial groups, 
             and to what extent does poverty contribute to these variations?
- What is the number of drug overdose deaths for each state?
- What is the percentage of people in poverty by race and state?
- How do the number of drug overdose deaths 
             and total number of people in poverty compare by region?
             
### Dataset at a Glance:
The datasets that we used offer a detailed exploration of mortality 
   and poverty dynamics in the United States during 2016. Our compilation uses these
   three datasets:
   
1. [Drug Overdose Deaths](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-05-fentanyl-and-cocaine-overdose-deaths/blob/master/data/vssr/VSRR_Provisional_Drug_Overdose_Death_Counts.csv)
2. [People in Poverty Based on Race for each State](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=5&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
3. [Population by Race for each State](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=5&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
             
### Ethical Considerations
- _Privacy and Identification:_ Address potential privacy concerns and the risk of individual or community 
         identification, particularly with race and region data.
- _Data Accuracy:_ Consider the accuracy and reliability of reported death and overdose 
         numbers, ensuring consistency in data collection methods across states.
- _Ethical Use of Racial Data:_ Handle racial data with care to avoid reinforcing stereotypes or biases, 
         and address the potential risks of stigmatization or discrimination.
- _Implications of Poverty Percentage:_ Ethically interpret and present poverty percentages, 
         considering potential consequences and avoiding misuse of the information.
